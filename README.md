# CS-370

## Project Overview

In this project, I worked on implementing a reinforcement learning solution to train an intelligent agent (the pirate) to navigate a maze and find the treasure. The project involved applying key concepts in reinforcement learning, particularly **Q-Learning**, to solve a real-world problem. 

I was given the foundational structure of the environment, including:
- The maze layout
- Rules for traversal
- The basic framework for the agent's interactions with the environment.

## My Contributions

- **Training Loop**: I implemented the training loop for the agent, where the agent learns to balance exploration and exploitation using the **epsilon-greedy strategy**.
- **Rewards and Penalties System**: I wrote code to manage the rewards and penalties system, ensuring the agent receives:
  - Positive rewards for moving closer to the treasure or collecting it.
  - Negative rewards for revisiting cells or standing idle.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: I fine-tuned hyperparameters such as the learning rate, discount factor, and epsilon decay rate to optimize the agent's performance.

## Problem-Solving Approach

As a computer scientist, I approach problems methodically by breaking them down into smaller, manageable components. For this project:
1. I first understood the problem domain (**maze navigation**) and the tools available (**Q-Learning, neural networks**).
2. I designed a solution by combining theoretical knowledge (e.g., reinforcement learning principles) with practical implementation (coding the training loop).
3. I iteratively tested and refined the solution, analyzing results and adjusting parameters to improve performance.

This structured approach ensures that solutions are not only functional but also scalable and adaptable to new challenges.

## Ethical Responsibilities

As a developer and computer scientist, I have ethical responsibilities to ensure that the systems I create are safe, reliable, and fair. For example:

- **To the End User**: I must ensure that the intelligent agent behaves predictably and does not cause harm or frustration. If this were a real-world application, such as a robot navigating a warehouse, errors could lead to inefficiencies or accidents.
- **To the Organization**: I must prioritize transparency and accountability in my work. This includes documenting code clearly, adhering to best practices, and considering the societal impact of the technology. For instance, if the agent were used in decision-making processes, I would need to ensure it avoids biases and operates ethically.

## Reflections

This project deepened my understanding of **reinforcement learning** and **neural networks**, two critical areas in artificial intelligence. By implementing the training loop and managing the agent's learning process, I gained hands-on experience with concepts like:
- The **epsilon-greedy strategy**
- **Replay buffers**
- Reward systems

These skills are directly applicable to larger-scale problems in AI, such as autonomous vehicles or recommendation systems.
